# Advanced-Prompt-Engineering# 🤖 Advanced Prompt Engineering & Chatbot Development

This repository demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques with a focus on building a context-aware chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 via OpenAI’s API.

The main notebook, `Creating_ChatBot.ipynb`, guides you through designing effective prompts, managing user interactions, and improving response quality—all key skills in modern prompt engineering.
